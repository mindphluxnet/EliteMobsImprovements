### EliteMobsImprovements

A small plugin to change some Minecraft defaults in order to improve EliteMobs gameplay:

- players no longer drop their equipped items on death
- while in adventure zones, players respawn at the closest defined graveyard instead of the server default
- players no longer lose experience on death
